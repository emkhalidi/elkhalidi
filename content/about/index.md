My name is Tyler ðŸ‘‹, but I go by Zaney online. I have been using Linux for years now and really enjoy what the ecosystem has to offer. I create videos on my experience with Linux, share my configuration files, and try to share what I've learned with anyone in the community.


I am an avid [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) user and have for a long time enjoyed using tiling window managers. I enjoy tinkering with things and having a really polished experience. When I first really got interested in learning Linux, it was because of people who had systems that looked like mine. So hopefully I can peek your interest in Linux & make the process of getting to where I am much, much simpler!

I share my [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/dotfiles), the configuration files for UNIX systems, so anyone who would like to look under the hood of my system can. Want to know how I theme a certain application? It's there. What is that thing I use to copy emoji's into the clipboard? Explained [there](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/dotfiles/-/blob/main/.local/bin/emopicker9000) too.


Even though, I have gone through a lot of work to make my configuration something that almost anyone can setup and use. It is designed to be a template for you to build off of - a starting point if you will. I personally believe no operating system is truly a _"one size fits all"_ solution. The programs and configs for each, that make up a system is what really decides whether or not you fall in love with it.
