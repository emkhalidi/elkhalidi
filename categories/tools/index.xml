      <description>I have had such a wonderful time using Hugo and I really do enjoy all of the things it allows me to do with ease. Even though there are plenty of fantastic guides for installing and configuring Hugo, I wanted to try my hand. Most guides or tutorials out there focus on deploying to Github or just don&amp;rsquo;t cover the topic at all.</description>

      <description>I want to dive into a change I recently made in my Linux setup that might surprise a few of you. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched from PCManFM to Thunar as my file manager.First off, PCManFM has been a solid companion on my Linux journey. It&amp;rsquo;s lightweight, fast, and offers a great set of features. However, as I delved deeper into tweaking my workflow and optimizing my system, I found myself gravitating towards Thunar for a few key reasons.</description>

      <description>I want to shed some light on why I chose Hugo for the new website here and the reasons behind my decision to transition to this robust static site generator. I have been putting off Hugo as I wanted to get better at writing my own CSS from scratch. Now that I have given it a try, I cannot believe I waited so long!</description>
