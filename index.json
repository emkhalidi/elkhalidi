[{"content":"My name is Tyler 👋, but I go by Zaney online. I have been using Linux for years now and really enjoy what the ecosystem has to offer. I create videos on my experience with Linux, share my configuration files, and try to share what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned with anyone in the community.\nI am an avid Hyprland user and have for a long time enjoyed using tiling window managers. I enjoy tinkering with things and having a really polished experience. When I first really got interested in learning Linux, it was because of people who had systems that looked like mine. So hopefully I can peek your interest in Linux \u0026amp; make the process of getting to where I am much, much simpler!\nI share my dotfiles, the configuration files for UNIX systems, so anyone who would like to look under the hood of my system can. Want to know how I theme a certain application? It\u0026rsquo;s there. What is that thing I use to copy emoji\u0026rsquo;s into the clipboard? Explained there too.\nEven though, I have gone through a lot of work to make my configuration something that almost anyone can setup and use. It is designed to be a template for you to build off of - a starting point if you will. I personally believe no operating system is truly a \u0026ldquo;one size fits all\u0026rdquo; solution. The programs and configs for each, that make up a system is what really decides whether or not you fall in love with it.\nFeel free to contact me by email, on Discord, or over on Mastodon.\n","date":"12 January 2024","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"My name is Tyler 👋, but I go by Zaney online.

I don\u0026rsquo;t like drama; however, I did a YouTube Short about the Librem 11 tablet and it was brought to my attention that Purism are involved in a little scandal. It\u0026rsquo;s not so little let me tell you that right now. This led me down a rabbit hole and since I did make content promoting one of their products I feel it\u0026rsquo;s important to bring this to peoples attention.\nNow before diving into this rabbit hole I only knew Purism as a company that makes privacy focused hardware and only really knew them for their Librem 5 phone. Now they started the crowd funding back in 2017 and it was either then or in 2018 when I heard about it. There was a real hype around this product in the Linux space.\nWell our story mainly revolves around this device in particular. Would it surprise you to find out that this phone is still rare to this day? People are still waiting on this phone and Purism is being accused of being a real pain to deal with.\nI will be using a lot of images I get from forums to illustrate the sentiment that backers have and aggrigate all of these posts into one place. One of the things that people are accusing Purism of doing is silencing some of the critism. Now most of these are from their forums so if they are removing and silencing people then they are very bad at it. However, on the off chance that these threads are nuked I will have bits of them here.\nThe Wait # As I said before people have had to wait until very recently (for the most part) to recieve their phones. Now even though the phone was being crowdfunded in 2017 that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it was in production or even close to ready and people understood that. So when did the phone release? Well from Wikipedia, \u0026ldquo;On September 24, 2019, Purism announced that the first batch of limited-production Librem 5 phones (Aspen) had started shipping.\u0026rdquo;\nNow here\u0026rsquo;s a good laugh, a couple sentences later on the Wikipedia page, \u0026ldquo;However, it was later reported, that the Aspen batch had been shipped only to employees and developers.\u0026rdquo; I just am stumped at why you would announce something to the public when it\u0026rsquo;s not the public who is getting anything. That\u0026rsquo;s like Sony announcing their shipping the new Playstations only to find out the devices are going to developers and Sony employees only.\nThe second batch was 100 phones and shipped in December. Hilariously though there wasn\u0026rsquo;t audio for phone calls. That was fixed a few weeks later. 🤦\nThe People Still Waiting # As you can see from the picture above people who ordered back in 2019 are getting their phones this year! Many in these forums are talking about how by the time they get the phone it\u0026rsquo;s completely obsolete. I mean the average upgrade timeframe is the same for the delivery time of one of these phones.\nThis next photo is of someone who had got his Librem 5 this year and ordered it in 2017!\nJust so we can address the fact that this isn\u0026rsquo;t just a couple or few people, here\u0026rsquo;s the next two posts:\nPossible banning # So there is a lot of people claiming that Purism was banning them from speaking on their forums. From what I can tell it seems to be plausible, as many are upset and it is their forums. However, if they were doing it they have clearly stopped for the time being and seem to have a \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t touch that shit\u0026rdquo; approach.\nWhich is definitely better than silencing critism and grievences from your customers and investors.\nThe Shady # Now before I continue on I want to make something clear. I have read through Purism\u0026rsquo;s forums and I know there will be many defenders coming to Purism\u0026rsquo;s aid. However, if your here to defend Purism I want you to look at this post:\nThe company is clearly ignoring refunds, or at the very least, not holding up their end of the agreement. Making people wait many months for a refund, if not years, is unacceptable. The insane part to me is people are defending this policy. A policy that allows them to essentially ignore you completely until they decide they are ready.\nLook, you could easily make the argument that the sole purpose of this policy is to hopefully keep the people who would get their money back strung along for long enough to get them to give up and just accept the phone. Also the fact that anyone in the community would hope that fundraising money could help give refunds is a horrid look, period.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s this post here which, holy shit man, this speaks volumes:\nNo Money? # I have really enjoyed reading all the people defending Purism and saying they\u0026rsquo;re financially sound, then reading posts like this:\nand a couple posts down:\nPurism Addresses Things? # Nope. Here\u0026rsquo;s a very reasonable guy with a reasonable take on the situation on the forums.\nThe sad thing is the fact that they haven\u0026rsquo;t commented on the situation or tried to address it makes them look like they\u0026rsquo;re struggling. I mean when people are resorting to contacting government agencies to try to get their money back, it\u0026rsquo;s bad.\nMy Thoughts # I think Purism, has developed a reputation as an untrustworthy company that doesn\u0026rsquo;t deliver on its products or promises. I have heard this sentiment repeated in many places I have gone online, their own forums, and in private conversations.\nI wish this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case as in the privacy respecting, Linux or FOSS hardware space we need more companies. Maybe Purism will overcome this and continue to make products and pull in sales.\nHowever, I just don\u0026rsquo;t see that happening. After reading just half of these horror stories online, I would choose to go with another companies offerings. Not to mention, I am not convinced this company is not in some serious financial trouble. At the very least think about it like this: if I sold you a phone and it took years to show up, for any reason, would you buy another from me?\n","date":"3 December 2023","permalink":"/posts/purism-is-not-good/","section":"Posts","summary":"Purism manufactures the Librem personal computing devices with a focus on software freedom, computer security, and internet privacy.

First and foremost, I want to express my appreciation for your hard work and dedication in creating Deadside, a game that has garnered a growing and passionate community of players. The immersive open-world experience you\u0026rsquo;ve crafted is truly impressive and I really do love it.\nWhere I\u0026rsquo;m Coming From # I am writing on behalf of the Linux and Steam Deck gaming community to kindly request your consideration for Linux compatibility for Deadside.\nI want to make it clear that I understand Linux users don\u0026rsquo;t make up the largest percentage of gamers. I also am fully aware that playing a game like Deadside on the Deck is not ideal. As someone who has and sometimes still plays Dayz on his Deck, I think this would be great.\nWhy Spend The Effort? # Here are a few reasons why extending Deadside\u0026rsquo;s compatibility to Linux and the Steam Deck would be greatly appreciated:\nLinux gaming has gained momentum over the years, and the recent introduction of the Steam Deck \u0026amp; new OLED version has further fueled the enthusiasm. By offering Linux compatibility, you can tap into a new and enthusiastic audience of gamers who are eager to explore the world of your game. Your community of players has been consistently supportive and vocal about their desire for Linux compatibility and Steam Deck support. By addressing their requests, you not only enhance player satisfaction but also show that you are responsive to their needs. Even when it\u0026rsquo;s only a small portion of them being affected. By ensuring compatibility with Linux and the Steam Deck, you make Deadside more future-proof. The Linux user base is continually growing, and products like the Steam Deck are game-changers in portable gaming. Your investment in compatibility can pay off for years to come. Not to mention the fact that there is no porting necessary to ensure compatibility. Proton already works with your game. I was using it to play Deadside originally before Easy Anti-Cheat was implemented. Now you don\u0026rsquo;t have to remove the Anti-Cheat or change it. Just enable and/or whitelist Linux as a platform for it.\nI and many others hope you will consider adding Linux compatibility to Deadside. Your consideration of this request would not only be a significant step towards inclusivity but also a testament to your commitment to the gaming community at large.\nThank you for taking the time to read this message. Hope to be hearing from you and, if possible, to be enjoying Deadside on Linux and the Steam Deck in the near future. 😜\n","date":"27 November 2023","permalink":"/posts/deadside-linux-request/","section":"Posts","summary":"I am writing on behalf of the Linux and Steam Deck gaming community to kindly request your consideration for two significant developments: Linux compatibility and Steam Deck support for Deadside.","title":"A Polite Request for Linux Compatibility and Steam Deck Support for Deadside"},{"content":"","date":"27 November 2023","permalink":"/tags/deadside/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Deadside"},{"content":"","date":"27 November 2023","permalink":"/tags/development/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Development"},{"content":"","date":"27 November 2023","permalink":"/categories/gaming/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Gaming"},{"content":"","date":"27 November 2023","permalink":"/tags/gitlab/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Gitlab"},{"content":"","date":"27 November 2023","permalink":"/categories/how-to/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"How To"},{"content":"I have had such a wonderful time using Hugo and I really do enjoy all of the things it allows me to do with ease. Even though there are plenty of fantastic guides for installing and configuring Hugo, I wanted to try my hand. Most guides or tutorials out there focus on deploying to Github or just don\u0026rsquo;t cover the topic at all.\nI hope you find this informative, let\u0026rsquo;s get started. 🏃\nInstalling Hugo # I currently use Arch Linux so the commands and instructions below will be for that system. If you are using something else then you can go here and return to the section for creating your first project and continue from there.\nStep 1: Update System Packages # Ensure your system is up to date by running:\nsudo pacman -Syu Step 2: Install Hugo # Installing Hugo on Arch, and many other systems out there, is as simple as running a single command in the terminal. Like so:\nsudo pacman -S hugo git go Step 3: Verify Installation # Check if Hugo installed correctly:\nhugo version Create A New Project # Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and make a new Hugo website. We will create it and move into the directory, like so:\nhugo new site mywebsite cd mywebsite Adding A Hugo Theme # Step 1: Choose a Theme # Welcome to the fun part, choosing the template for your website. You can find a theme you like on the Hugo Themes page.\nStep 2: Add the Theme to Your Project # Add the theme as a submodule:\ngit init git submodule add \u0026lt;theme-git-url\u0026gt; themes/\u0026lt;theme-name\u0026gt; Step 3: Configure the Theme # Edit your site\u0026rsquo;s configuration file (config.toml or config.yaml) to set the theme:\ntheme = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;theme-name\u0026gt;\u0026#34; There will most likely be extra configuration needed depending on the theme you have selected. So please refer to the themes documentation before continuing.\nHow To Organize Content # I am using a theme called Blowfish so I am going to use that as the example of how it recommends setting up your project. Even though you may need to setup things a little different for different themes most things should be the same.\nHere is a general overview of how my folder structure looks for my project:\n. ├── assets │ └── img │ └── author.jpg ├── config │ └── _default ├── content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── about.md │ └── posts │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-post.md │ └── another-post │ ├── aardvark.jpg │ └── index.md └── themes └── blowfish Now would be a great time to go ahead and add some starter content for your website. So maybe take a pause on trying to get your site deployed and make sure you have something good to look at.\nDeploying to GitLab Pages # Step 1: Create a GitLab Repository # Create a new blank repository for your Hugo site on GitLab.\nStep 2: Initialize Git and Add Remote # Inside your Hugo project directory:\ngit remote add origin \u0026lt;gitlab-repo-url\u0026gt; Step 3: Create CI YAML File # You now need to create the file to let Gitlab know what to do so your website gets built and works. It should look like this, or at least similar:\n# # Before using this .gitlab-ci.yml: # # - This example uses the latest Docker image, but you might want to use the # exact version to avoid any broken pipelines. # All available Hugo versions are listed under https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo/container_registry. # - Read about the difference between hugo and hugo_extended # https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo/-/blob/main/README.md#hugo-vs-hugo_extended. # - To change the theme, see # https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo/-/blob/main/README.md#use-a-custom-theme. # image: registry.gitlab.com/pages/hugo/hugo:latest variables: GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive test: script: - hugo except: - master pages: script: - hugo artifacts: paths: - public only: - master Step 4: Commit and Push Changes # git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git push -u origin master Step 5: Configure GitLab Pages # Go to your GitLab repository. Navigate to Settings \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Visibility. Make sure the option for Pages is set to Anyone With Access. Step 6: Access Your Site # Once the GitLab Pages pipeline finishes building and deploying, access your site at:\nhttps://\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.gitlab.io/\u0026lt;repository-name\u0026gt; Congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;re Done! # All that\u0026rsquo;s left for you to do is link your domain to the repo, which the options for can be found under Deploy \u0026gt; Pages. Now the instructions on this vary wildy depending on where you have your domains through. So if you need help there just search \u0026ldquo;how to setup dns for gitlab pages for (insert domain provider)\u0026rdquo; on Google.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve successfully installed Hugo, added a theme, hopefully added some quality content, and deployed your site to GitLab Pages.\nHope this has helped you.

I\u0026rsquo;ve switched from PCManFM to Thunar as my file manager. Now, why the shift?\nFirst off, PCManFM has been a solid companion on my Linux journey. It\u0026rsquo;s lightweight, fast, and offers a great set of features. However, as I delved deeper into tweaking my workflow and optimizing my system, I found myself gravitating towards Thunar for a few key reasons.\nCustomization and Extensibility: Thunar, despite being known for its simplicity, surprised me with its level of customization. The ability to add custom actions, plugins, and even scripts felt more accessible and robust compared to PCManFM. It opened up new possibilities to streamline my tasks and tailor my file manager to suit my workflow. Also it looks incredible in comparison. 😉 Integration and Stability: While PCManFM worked well for basic file management, I noticed Thunar integrated more seamlessly with my system. Its stability and consistent performance, especially when handling larger files or dealing with various file types, made it a reliable choice for day-to-day usage. Community Support and Development: Thunar\u0026rsquo;s active community and ongoing development were additional factors influencing my switch. Regular updates, bug fixes, and the community-driven nature of Thunar gave me confidence in its long-term support and continuous improvement. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say PCManFM doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a great community with active development though. Feature Set and Flexibility: While both PCManFM and Thunar offer a range of features, I found Thunar\u0026rsquo;s balance between simplicity and functionality more aligned with my needs. Its tabbed browsing, dual-pane view, and advanced file management options provided the flexibility I sought without overwhelming me with unnecessary complexities. Performance and Resource Usage: Admittedly, PCManFM is known for its lightweight nature, but my experience with Thunar didn\u0026rsquo;t significantly impact my system\u0026rsquo;s performance. It ran smoothly, and the benefits it brought in terms of features and usability outweighed any marginal resource usage differences. In essence, this switch from PCManFM to Thunar wasn\u0026rsquo;t about one being inherently better than the other. Both file managers have their strengths and cater to different user preferences. For me, at this point in my Linux journey, Thunar aligns more closely with the customization, stability, and flexibility I want.\nRemember, the beauty of the Linux ecosystem lies in the plethora of choices available to us. Experimenting, exploring, and finding what works best for your setup is what makes it all the more exciting.\nWhat about you? Have you made a similar switch or found your favorite file manager? Share your thoughts in the comments below!\nUntil next time, happy tinkering and keep exploring the world of free and open source software!\n","date":"27 November 2023","permalink":"/posts/why-i-moved-to-thunar/","section":"Posts","summary":"I want to dive into a change I recently made in my Linux setup that might surprise a few of you.

I have been putting off Hugo as I wanted to get better at writing my own CSS from scratch. Now that I have given it a try, I cannot believe I waited so long! 🤦\nWhat is Hugo? # First let me explain what Hugo is. Hugo describes itself like so, \u0026ldquo;The world’s fastest framework for building websites.\u0026rdquo; It is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.\nChoosing Hugo: The Initial Reasons # When it came to selecting a platform for my website, I delved into various options. Here\u0026rsquo;s why Hugo stood out:\nSpeed and Performance # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s 🌩️ lightning-fast processing speed was the first thing that caught my eye. As a content creator and someone deeply entrenched in the tech world, having a website that loads swiftly was non-negotiable. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s ability to generate static pages at an incredible speed aligned perfectly with my requirements.\nThis is also true for the speed at which you can pick it up. There are many incredible themes available with amazing documentation. That can not only assist you in customizing your site to your liking, but teach you how to use Hugo itself. The community behind this project will blow your mind.\nSimplicity and Ease of Use # The simplicity of Hugo\u0026rsquo;s setup and workflow resonated with me. Its minimalistic approach made it easy to get started without drowning in excessive configuration. Its straightforward templating system and familiar Markdown content structure were a breath of fresh air.\nIf you want to make something really beautiful, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend all your time trying to be a half decent designer, then you have to give Hugo a try.\nFlexibility and Extensibility # Hugo\u0026rsquo;s flexibility in terms of themes and its extensible architecture has allowed me to personalize my website without constraints. Its robust theming capabilities meant I could craft a unique look and feel for my content, keeping it in line with my branding and style.\nAll with little to no effort, as my theme came with many options for very quick changes to accent color, layouts, and much more. I can always add custom css on top to really set myself apart as well.\nCommunity and Support # Being part of a vibrant community of developers and users who actively contribute to Hugo\u0026rsquo;s growth and improvement was a really big factor in my decision. The brilliant Hugo documentation and the communities well made themes and their great documentation made learning an enjoyable experience.\nTransitioning to Hugo: The Motivations # Now, why was I considering the switch?\nEvolving Needs and Features # As my content and web development endeavors have evolved, I find myself seeking more dynamic features for my website. While Hugo excelled in speed and simplicity, I\u0026rsquo;m now exploring functionalities that necessitate a more dynamic approach to content management.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a fancy way of saying that I very much want to push out content not just over on YouTube, but here as well. For doing this kind of content I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to do a bunch of HTML all the time. That just makes writing up something, especially that looks as nice as this, take forever. Thanks to Hugo I can not only get out content faster, but also have something I know looks great to build off!\nEnhanced Content Management # The need for a more intuitive content management system has arisen as I eluded to above. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s Markdown-based approach is fantastic for straightforward content creation. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to have found a system that allows for more interactive and collaborative content management. Even though here this is just for me to post, with Hugo having a site with multiple authors is a breeze!\nExperimentation and Growth # As a tech enthusiast, the allure of experimenting with different platforms and technologies is always present. Exploring new tools and methodologies in web development is part of my journey, and I\u0026rsquo;m eager to delve into different frameworks and CMS options to further expand my skill set as time goes on too.\nUser Experience and Accessibility # Improving the user experience and ensuring accessibility for a wider audience are paramount. Hugo delivered on speed and performance, and on massively improving the overall look of my site. I firmly believe Hugo is perfect for most of us out there looking to have a platform to speak that we can really call our own.\nIt will enable you to build a website that people will actually want to look at without having to become an advanced web developer. Hugo also makes the formatting of writing your content much easier to manage and streamlines a lot of the process for making an incredible blog. I hope you will reach out and share what you make or have made with this incredible piece of software.\nWrapping It Up # Hugo has been an incredible companion for my website journey, offering speed, simplicity, and flexibility.
